Negative scores indicate reductions in kg/m\^2; positive scores indicate increases in BMI. | Delay discounting will be assessed using a computerized task that assess participants' indifference points, or the objective amount of a smaller, immediate reward that is subjectively equivalent to a delayed, larger reward ($100), across a range of delays (1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, and 12 years). Indifference points will be expressed as a proportion of the larger reward (0 to 1). This delay discounting curve (indifference points as a function of delay) will be summarized using area under the curve (AUC), calculated using subjective value of the delayed reward (0 to 1) as the y-axis unit and delay as the x-axis unit. Individual delays are converted to ordinal units (1-7) prior to analysis. AUC is expressed as a proportion of the maximum possible AUC. This normalized measure of AUC varies from 0 (maximum discounting) to 1 (minimum discounting).

Next, an occlusive pressure is applied (using a blood pressure cuff inflated to a suprasystolic pressure)for a period of 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, the cuff is rapidly deflated. This produces a reactive hyperemic response which is captured via ultrasound at 1 minute post cuff deflation (also 10 EKG-gated images averaged). The diameter of the artery following reactive hyperemia is calculated and compared to the resting diameter to obtain a percent dilation. This is flow-mediated dilation. | Insulin sensitivity (M) is measured by using a hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp. Insulin sensitivity (M) was calculated as the average glucose infusion rate (mg/kg of body weight per min) over the last 30 min of the clamp.

An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product, is also an AE. | An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.

Study drug was administered on Day -1. Plasma concentrations of MK-8521 were determined at -10 min pre-GGI and 40, 80, 120 \& 160 min and blood concentrations of glucose, insulin \& C-peptide were determined at -10, -5 (pre-GGI), 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140 \& 160 minutes after start of GGI on Day 1 of each period. ISR calculated by deconvolution of C-peptide concentrations using a two-compartmental model was regressed on glucose concentration via simple linear regression; beta cell glucose sensitivity was defined as slope from the regression line.","From Day 1 through post-trial visit (Up to 8 weeks) | Up to 8 weeks (Part 1) | Pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 24, 30, 34, 48, 72, 96, 120 hrs. post-dose (Part 1) | Pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 24, 30, 34, 48, 72, 96, 120 hrs. post-dose (Part 1) | Pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 24, 30, 34, 48, 72, 96, 120 hrs. post-dose (Part 1) | Pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 24, 30, 34, 48, 72, 96, 120 hrs. post-dose (Part 1) | From Day 1 through post-trial visit (Up to 7 weeks) | Up to 7 weeks (Part 2) | Days 1, 5 and 10 (Part 2) (Panels C, D, E) | Days 1, 7 and 14 (Part 2) (Panel F) | Days 1, 5 and 10 (Part 2) (Panels C, D, E) | Days 1, 7 and 14 (Part 2) (Panel F) | Days 1, 5 and 10 (Part 2) (Panels C, D, E) | Days 1, 7 and 14 (Part 2) (Panel F) | Days 1, 5 and 10 (Part 2) (Panels C, D, E) | Days 1, 7 and 14 (Part 2) (Panel F) | Days 1, 5 and 10 (Part 2) (Panels C, D, E) | Days 1, 7 and 14 (Part 2) (Panel F) | Up to 6 weeks (Part 3) | Up to 6 weeks (Part 3) | From -10 to 160 minutes after GGI on Day 1 (Part 3)",,0,,,,61.0

Explanted sentinel units from subjects were processed and stained for markers identifying the number of graft cell nuclei (i.e., signifying the cells were viable). The percentage of viable graft cells in these explanted units were then compared to the percentage of viable graft cells from the pre-clinical (i.e., animal) models. These pre-clinical models are based on animal studies performed at ViaCyte (ref: internal study report). The data in Outcome Measure Data Table represent the % of viable graft cells present in the explanted sentinels compared to what was expected based on the animal model at Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 26 (e.g., At Week 4, there was an average of 18.27% viable graft cells in the participant's explants compared to what was expected based on the animal models). | Evaluation of clinical efficacy of VC-01 combination product in Cohort 2 subjects was intended by measuring C-peptide levels during a 4-hour Mixed Meal Tolerance Test (MMTT). Blood glucose and C-peptide data were collected from subjects at timepoints 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240 minutes after ingestion of a ""meal"" (i.e., BOOST drink). These C-peptide data points could be used to create the AUC calculation. If the implanted units contained mature, insulin-producing cells, stimulated C-peptide levels would be expected to increase over the time course in reaction to the meal.","Weeks 4, 8, 12 and 26 | To Week 26",,0,,,,62.0

An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to 14 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state. | A hypoglycemic event (HAE) was identified by characteristic symptoms or blood glucose levels. HAE was defined as 1 of the given definitions: 1) Characteristic symptoms of HAE with no home glucose monitoring performed where clinical picture included prompt resolution with food intake, subcutaneous glucagon, or intravenous glucose; 2) Characteristic symptoms of HAE with home glucose monitoring measurement of less than or equal to (=\<) 70 milligram per deciliter (mg/dL) using sponsor-provided, plasma-referenced, home glucometers (or central laboratory); 3) any glucose value =\<49 mg/dL using sponsor-provided, plasma-referenced, home glucometers (or central laboratory) with or without accompanying symptoms. |  |  | AUC24 is the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time zero (pre-dose) to 24 hours post-dose (0 to 24). |  |  | AUC24 is the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time zero (pre-dose) to 24 hours post-dose (0 to 24). | Ctrough is the concentration prior to study drug administration. | Cav is the average plasma concentration during the 0 to 24 hour time period. | Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes.

Terminal half-life is calculated by dividing the natural logarithm to the base e (Log e) multiplied by (\*) 2/k el, where 'k el' is the terminal phase rate constant calculated by a linear regression of the log-linear concentration-time curve.

Cardiac output (CO) is measured using velocity encoded phase contrast MRI. The patient lies in the MRI scanner, and the imaging plane is positioned perpendicular to the ascending aorta where blood flow can be measured accurately. The MRI scan is synchronized with the patient's heartbeats using ECG gating. Two types of images are collected: magnitude images, which provide anatomical reference, phase images, which encode the speed and direction of blood flow. The system multiplies velocity by the cross-sectional area of the vessel to calculate the volume of blood passing through the vessel at each moment. Integrating the flow values over the entire cardiac cycle, the system calculates the stroke volume. Cardiac Output = Stroke Volume × Heart Rate | A measurement, expressed as a percentage, of how much blood the left ventricle pumps out with each heartbeat. It's a key indicator of heart function and can help diagnose and track heart failure. A normal EF typically falls between 55% and 70%.
