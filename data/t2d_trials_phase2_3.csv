The VerifyNow PRU assay measures effects on platelet activation caused by inhibition of the platelet receptor, P2Y12. This receptor is activated by adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP) in the cascade leading to platelet aggregation but can be blocked by P2Y12 inhibitor drugs, such as clopidogrel. Blockage of this receptor diminishes platelet activation and the ability of platelets to bind to fibrinogen. VerifyNow PRU assay values \< 180 units indicate impairment of platelet aggregation. | Platelet reactivity, as measured by VerifyNow ARU assay, and presented as number of participants with ≤ 549 ARU or \> 549 ARU post-baseline (Days 8 and 14), by baseline category.

Aspirin irreversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase 1, which converts arachidonic acid to thromboxane A2, which in turn is involved in the activation of the glycoprotein (GP)IIb/IIIa receptor necessary to initiate platelet aggregation. Impairment of platelet aggregation of the aspirin type is defined for the VerifyNow aspirin assay as values ≤ 549 ARU. | The VerifyNow PRU assay measures effects on platelet activation caused by inhibition of the platelet receptor, P2Y12.

From these results, insulin resistance was then estimated using the updated homeostasis model assessment method for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) computer algorithm.

Pleasantness was assessed by asking 'How pleasant is this taste?', with responses ranging from -100 (most unpleasant imaginable) to 100 (most pleasant imaginable).

Desire to consume was assessed by asking 'How much would you want to eat/drink this?', with responses ranging from -100 (least desirable imaginable) to 100 (most desirable imaginable). | The fMRI paradigm assesses evoked BOLD response to cue-elicited anticipation and receipt of a milkshake and water. A region-of-interest (ROI) approach is used to assess changes in BOLD signal in the striatum.

Positive values reflect a higher striatal BOLD activation for the milkshake; negative reflects a higher striatal BOLD activation for the water. Parameter estimates of the relative BOLD response to each of these contrasts are extracted and compared between the two arms.

Baseline pulse amplitude will be measured for 5 minutes, then the arterial flow will then be interrupted for 5 minutes with a cuff placed on a proximal forearm. Pulse amplitude will be recorded electronically and analyzed by a computerized and automated algorithm. The change from the baseline measurement will be expressed as the reactive hyperemia index (RHI). We will calculate the pulse amplitude response to hyperemia for each 30-second interval as a ratio of the post-deflation pulse amplitude to the baseline pulse amplitude as described previously. The RHI ratio will be computed by dividing the ratio obtained on the test side over the ratio from the control finger.

The plus sign increases with a higher level of occult blood, glucose, ketones, proteins, RBC, WBC in the urine: 1+: slightly positive, 2+: positive, 3+: high positive. Participants were categorized as none seen or 1 based on the absence or presence, respectively, of cast, cellular cast, granular cast and hyaline cast. Higher value indicates higher abnormality. | Data for mean specific gravity is provided. Specific gravity is a measure of the amount of material dissolved in the urine. Specific gravity is the ratio of the density (mass of a unit volume) of a substance to the density (mass of the same unit volume) of a reference substance. Normal urine has a specific gravity between 1.010 and 1.020. | Urine pH is an acid-base measurement. pH is measured on a numeric scale ranging from 0 to 14; values on the scale refer to the degree of alkalinity or acidity. A pH of 7 is neutral. A pH less than 7 is acidic, and a pH greater than 7 is basic. Normal urine has a slightly acid pH (5.0 - 6.0). | Single 12-lead ECGs was obtained at each time point during the study using an ECG machine that automatically calculates the heart rate and measures PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals. It was assessed on Baseline (pre-dose Day -1), Day 7 and 15.

Stool sample was obtained any time after dosing on Day 7. | Vital signs assessment included heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Assessments were completed at pre morning dose on Day 1 (Baseline), Day 3, Day 8 (before discharge) and Follow-up. Criteria for vital sign values meeting PCI for Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) included: SBP \<85 and \>160 millimeters of mercury (mmHg), DBP \<45 and \>100 mmHg and HR \<40 and \>110 beats per minute (bpm). Only those parameters for which at least one value of PCI was reported are summarized. | 12-lead ECG assessments were obtained pre-dose at Day 1, Day 3, Day 8 (before discharge) and Follow-up. The assessments were done using an ECG machine that automatically calculated the heart rate and measures PQ, QRS, QT, and QTc(B) intervals. Abnormal ECG findings (clinically significant or not clinically significant) were categorized. The abnormal PCI range for T2DM participants include QTc interval of \>450 to \<=480 milliseconds (msec) and increase from Baseline QTc interval of \> 30 to \<=60 msec, PR interval \<110 and \>220 msec and QRS interval \<75 and \>110 msec. ECG abnormalities were categorized as clinically significant or not clinically significant based on PCI criteria and judgment of the investigator. Baseline was defined as the mean of three replicate assessments at pre-dose on Day 1. | The BSFR Scale assessed stool quality using a 7-point scale, where 1=separate hard lumps like nuts (difficult to pass) and 7=watery, no solid pieces (entirely liquid). Bristol Stool Form Scale Rating: 1=separate hard lumps, like nuts, 2=sausage shaped but lumpy, 3=like a sausage or snake but with cracks on its surface, 4=like a sausage or snake, smooth and soft, 5=soft blobs with clear cut edges, 6=fluffy pieces with ragged edges, a mushy stool, 7=watery, no solid pieces. Data is reported for number of events in participants with each category of BSFR scale across Day 1 to 7 post morning dose. | The BSFR Scale assessed stool quality using a 7-point scale, where 1=separate hard lumps like nuts (difficult to pass) and 7 = watery, no solid pieces (entirely liquid).

Data is reported for number of events in participants with each category of BSFR scale across Day 1 to 7 post morning dose. | The impact of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms on health-related quality of life was assessed using the GSRS. The GSRS is a 15-item related to abdominal pain, reflux, indigestion, diarrhea and constipation syndromes, self-administered questionnaire that assesses the impact of gastrointestinal symptoms during the past week on a scale from 1 (no discomfort at all) to 7 (very severe discomfort). Overall GSRS is the mean of questions 1-15 and range from 1 to 7, with lower scores indicating a better quality of life with respect to gastrointestinal symptoms. Baseline was defined as the assessment done on Day -1.
