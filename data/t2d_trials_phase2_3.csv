The VerifyNow PRU assay measures effects on platelet activation caused by inhibition of the platelet receptor, P2Y12. This receptor is activated by adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP) in the cascade leading to platelet aggregation but can be blocked by P2Y12 inhibitor drugs, such as clopidogrel. Blockage of this receptor diminishes platelet activation and the ability of platelets to bind to fibrinogen. VerifyNow PRU assay values \< 180 units indicate impairment of platelet aggregation. | Platelet reactivity, as measured by VerifyNow ARU assay, and presented as number of participants with ≤ 549 ARU or \> 549 ARU post-baseline (Days 8 and 14), by baseline category.

Aspirin irreversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase 1, which converts arachidonic acid to thromboxane A2, which in turn is involved in the activation of the glycoprotein (GP)IIb/IIIa receptor necessary to initiate platelet aggregation. Impairment of platelet aggregation of the aspirin type is defined for the VerifyNow aspirin assay as values ≤ 549 ARU. | The VerifyNow PRU assay measures effects on platelet activation caused by inhibition of the platelet receptor, P2Y12.

From these results, insulin resistance was then estimated using the updated homeostasis model assessment method for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) computer algorithm. A higher HOMA-IR indicates a higher degree of insulin resistance.

Endothelial function was assessed by RHI value determined using the noninvasive EndoPAT™ (Itamar Medical; Caesarea, Israel) device. RHI is a validated measure of endothelial function, with a higher RHI indicating better endothelial function compared to a lower value.
