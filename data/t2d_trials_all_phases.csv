The VerifyNow PRU assay measures effects on platelet activation caused by inhibition of the platelet receptor, P2Y12. This receptor is activated by adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP) in the cascade leading to platelet aggregation but can be blocked by P2Y12 inhibitor drugs, such as clopidogrel. Blockage of this receptor diminishes platelet activation and the ability of platelets to bind to fibrinogen. VerifyNow PRU assay values \< 180 units indicate impairment of platelet aggregation. | Platelet reactivity, as measured by VerifyNow ARU assay, and presented as number of participants with ≤ 549 ARU or \> 549 ARU post-baseline (Days 8 and 14), by baseline category.

Aspirin irreversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase 1, which converts arachidonic acid to thromboxane A2, which in turn is involved in the activation of the glycoprotein (GP)IIb/IIIa receptor necessary to initiate platelet aggregation. Impairment of platelet aggregation of the aspirin type is defined for the VerifyNow aspirin assay as values ≤ 549 ARU. | The VerifyNow PRU assay measures effects on platelet activation caused by inhibition of the platelet receptor, P2Y12.

ROC curves are plots of (1-sensitivity) vs. (1-specificity) for all possible screening cutoffs, so a higher AROC indicates higher predictive accuracy. A perfect test would have an AROC of 1.00, while a test equivalent to tossing a coin (random) would have an AROC of 0.50; if confidence limits include 0.50, predictive accuracy is no better than chance.

It is important to appreciate that while AROC analysis can show the relative accuracy of different screening tests, and aid the selection of which test to use in clinical practice, such an analysis does not define what the optimal screening test cutoff is. Selection of the optimal cutoff generally requires consideration of other factors, such as costs and/or the clinical importance of having higher or lower sensitivity.",3 years,,0,,,,1535
